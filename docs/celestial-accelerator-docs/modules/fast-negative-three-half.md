# Fast negative three-half exponent

The fast negative three-half exponent module is a critical component of the object processing unit, responsible for efficiently computing the x^(-3/2) operation required for gravitational force calculations.

## Purpose and importance

In n-body simulations, computing gravitational forces requires calculating:

\[ F = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2} \]

However, we also need the unit direction vector, which requires dividing by the distance. This results in needing \( r^{-3/2} \), making the fast negative three-half exponent crucial for performance.

## Algorithm basis

This module is based on a modification of the famous fast inverse square root algorithm, originally used in video games like Quake III. The algorithm uses bit manipulation and Newton-Raphson iteration to approximate the result much faster than traditional methods.

## Key advantages

### Speed optimization

- Significantly reduces the number of clock cycles needed for velocity updates
- Enables the accelerator to achieve substantial speedup over software implementations
- Critical for maintaining \( O(N) \) complexity in the hardware implementation

### Hardware efficiency

- Designed specifically for FPGA implementation
- Minimizes resource usage while maintaining accuracy
- Integrates seamlessly with the arithmetic units

## Implementation details

The module implements a modified version of the fast inverse square root that computes \( x^{-3/2} \) instead of \( x^{-1/2} \). This involves:

1. **Bit manipulation**: Initial approximation using IEEE 754 floating-point representation
2. **Newton-Raphson iteration**: Refines the approximation for better accuracy
3. **Optimization**: Tailored for the specific needs of gravitational calculations

## Performance impact

According to the performance analysis, even for the worst-case scenario of only 2 bodies, the optimized velocity update flow (including this module) provides a 626% speed increase compared to software implementation.

## Integration with velocity updates

The fast negative three-half exponent module works in conjunction with other components during velocity updates:

- Receives distance calculations from arithmetic units
- Provides normalized force magnitude for direction vector computation
- Enables efficient computation of gravitational accelerations for all body interactions
