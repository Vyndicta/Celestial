# Switch Module

The switch module is a critical component of the celestial accelerator, responsible for managing the connections between the top module and the body processing units. Its primary function is to facilitate the flow of data during the simulation of celestial bodies, ensuring that the necessary information is routed correctly to and from the various processing units.

## Functionality

- **Data Routing**: The switch module directs data packets from the top module to the appropriate body processing units based on the current simulation requirements. This includes sharing position updates and other relevant information needed for accurate calculations.

- **Control Signals**: It interprets control signals from the top module, determining which body processing unit should receive specific data. This allows for efficient communication and coordination among the processing units during the simulation.

- **Dynamic Connections**: The switch module can dynamically adjust its connections based on the simulation state, enabling it to handle varying numbers of bodies and different simulation scenarios effectively.

## Operation

1. **Initialization**: Upon startup, the switch module establishes initial connections with the top module and the body processing units. It prepares to receive commands and data packets.

2. **Receiving Commands**: The switch module listens for commands from the top module, which dictate the actions to be performed by the body processing units.

3. **Data Transmission**: When a command is received, the switch module routes the relevant data to the designated body processing unit. This includes position and velocity information, as well as any other parameters necessary for the simulation.

4. **Feedback Loop**: After processing, the body processing units send feedback to the switch module, which may include updated positions or collision detection results. The switch module then relays this information back to the top module for further processing.

## Conclusion

The switch module plays a vital role in the overall architecture of the celestial accelerator, ensuring seamless communication between the top module and the body processing units. Its ability to manage data flow efficiently is essential for the accurate and timely simulation of celestial dynamics.
