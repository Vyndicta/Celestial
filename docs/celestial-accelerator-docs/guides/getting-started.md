# Getting Started with the Celestial Accelerator

Welcome to the Celestial Accelerator documentation! This guide will help you set up and configure the accelerator for your simulations of celestial bodies. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A compatible development environment (e.g., Linux or Windows with WSL)
- Required software tools installed (e.g., C compiler, simulation tools)
- Access to the Celestial Accelerator source code

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Start by cloning the Celestial Accelerator repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/celestial-accelerator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd celestial-accelerator
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install any necessary dependencies. This may include libraries for simulation and data processing. Refer to the `README.md` for specific instructions on dependencies.

4. **Build the Project**
   Compile the source code using the provided build scripts or Makefile:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Configure the Accelerator**
   Before running simulations, you may need to configure the accelerator settings. This can typically be done in a configuration file located in the `config` directory. Adjust parameters such as the number of processing units and simulation time steps.

2. **Set Up the Simulation Environment**
   Prepare your simulation environment by defining the celestial bodies and their initial conditions. This can be done through a configuration file or directly in your C code.

## Running Your First Simulation

1. **Write Your Simulation Code**
   Create a new C file for your simulation. Use the example code snippets provided in `guides/c-code-examples.md` as a reference.

2. **Compile Your Simulation**
   Compile your simulation code along with the accelerator library:

   ```bash
   gcc -o my_simulation my_simulation.c -L. -lcelestial_accelerator
   ```

3. **Execute the Simulation**
   Run your compiled simulation:

   ```bash
   ./my_simulation
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup or execution, check the following:

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Review the configuration settings for any errors.
- Consult the `performance/performance-analysis.md` for insights on optimizing your simulations.

## Conclusion

You are now ready to use the Celestial Accelerator for your simulations! For more detailed information on each module and their functionalities, refer to the documentation in the `modules` directory. Happy simulating!
