This website documents the Celestial accelerator, an accelerator for n-body simulations. This hardware accelerator uses multiple processing elements and an optimized velocity update flow, so that the computation time scales in n instead of nÂ² as a software implementation would. The accelerator was built using Chipyard and Chisel. Example C codes are provided [here](https://github.com/Vyndicta/Celestial/tree/main/CelestialAccelerator/C_Codes), and an overview of the accelerator is provided [here](celestial-accelerator-docs/modules/overview).
